  "abstract": "In the last decade, many parts of the world experienced severe increases in agricultural land prices. This price surge, however, did not take place evenly in space and time. To better understand the spatial and temporal behavior of land prices, we employ a price diffusion model that combines features of market integration models and spatial econometric models. An application of this model to farmland prices in Germany shows that prices on a county-level are cointegrated. Apart from convergence toward a long-run equilibrium, we find that price transmission experiences short-term adjustments caused by neighboring regions.",

The article's title, authors, and affiliations were clearly stated, allowing for accurate extraction. The publication details, including journal name, volume, issue, and pages, were also explicitly mentioned. The abstract provided insights into the study's focus on farmland prices, which guided the identification of relevant datasets. However, specific dataset details such as geographic coordinates, temporal coverage, and variable descriptions were not explicitly provided in the text, leading to some fields being marked as empty or null. The confidence score reflects the completeness and clarity of the available information.",
