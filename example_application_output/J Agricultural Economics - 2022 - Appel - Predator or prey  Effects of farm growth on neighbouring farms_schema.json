  "abstract": "We provide explorative insights on how farms which manage strong and successful growth affect farms in their neighbourhoods through spatial competition for land. The study is based on an exploratory analysis of repeated framed experiments within the business game FarmAgriPoliS. In particular, we analyse the spatial influences of different behavioural clusters of farm managers.",
