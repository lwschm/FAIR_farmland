    "reasoning": "The extraction process involved identifying key metadata elements from the provided text, focusing on bibliographic details and dataset information related to farmland transactions. The article's title, authors, and affiliations were clearly stated, allowing for accurate extraction. The journal name, volume, issue, and page numbers were also explicitly mentioned. The abstract provided a summary of the research focus, which is crucial for understanding the context of the datasets. The dataset description was derived from the empirical analysis section, which detailed the data used in the study, including the number of transactions and the geographic focus on Lower Saxony, Germany. The temporal coverage was extracted from the dataset description, which mentioned the years 1990 to 2018. The extraction confidence is high due to the clarity and completeness of the provided information.",
