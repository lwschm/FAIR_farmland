It contains details on auction packages (lots), which may include one or more plots, and for each sale transaction, the date, number of bidders, and all bids are recorded. Additionally, information on plot size, number of plots, and soil quality is provided. The dataset was used to analyze the potential for increasing revenues through optimal reserve prices in land auctions.",
