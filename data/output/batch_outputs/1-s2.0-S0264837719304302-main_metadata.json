It contains information on the price, size, soil quality, location, and type (arable land or grassland) of the transacted plot. Since 2011, information about the buyer (farmer or non-farmer) is also available. The dataset was used to analyze the relationship between land price and parcel size using a nonparametric locally weighted scatterplot smoothing (LOWESS) estimator and a hedonic land price model.",
