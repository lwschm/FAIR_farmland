      "description": "The study uses a dataset of 9,754 first-price sealed-bid farmland privatisation auctions conducted in eastern Germany between 2007 and 2020. The data includes information on all bids and the auctioned goods, such as location, lot size, lot type (shares of arable, grassland, and other land), lot composition (number of parcels), and soil quality. Additionally, local experts' appraisals, which remain private to the auctioneer, are used to account for unobserved heterogeneity. These appraisals are based on publicly available results of transactions and auctions of similar lots in the same region during the 12 months prior to the auction. The dataset is used to test the presence of common values in bidders' valuations and the potential for a winner's curse in farmland auctions.",
