The data was used to define four ecosystem function indicators: the Shannon diversity index, edge density, and shares of grassland and ecological focus areas. The IACS data provided spatially explicit information at the plot level of registered plots above the minimum eligible size of 0.3 ha, including location, shape, land use, crop choice, and ecological focus areas.",
