      "description": "The dataset consists of over 12,000 first-price-sealed-bid auctions of agricultural land conducted by BVVG in Eastern Germany between 2005 and 2019. The data includes information on the winning bid, the total number of bidders, the exact date of the auction, the location, plot-specific land characteristics including a soil quality index, the lot size, the number of land parcels, and the type of use (arable land versus pasture), as well as the type of tender (open versus restricted). The data was used to analyze the effectiveness of restricted tendering procedures in allowing structurally disadvantaged groups to purchase agricultural land at lower prices. The study found that restricted tendering did not achieve its intended purpose of lowering purchase prices, although it did reduce the number of bidders.",
