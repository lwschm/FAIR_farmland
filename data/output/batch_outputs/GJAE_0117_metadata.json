This dataset includes transaction prices, lot sizes, soil quality, type of land use (arable land or grassland), and anonymized information about buyer and seller types. The data is used to analyze the relationship between land use concentration and farmland prices, revealing a negative relationship that suggests market power on the buyer side.",
