      "description": "The study uses data from experiments conducted with the business game FarmAgriPoliS, which is based on the AgriPoliS model. This model simulates farms, regional farm populations, and structures, focusing on strategic decisions like farm exit or continuation, investments, and land rentals. The experiments involved 49 students managing pre-specified farms in a simulated environment representing the Altmark region in Germany. The dataset includes 143 experiments across nine scenarios, with data on farm investments, land rentals, farm sizes, financial results, and rents paid.",
