This dataset includes all plots registered to receive European subsidies, based on a geo-referenced land parcel identification system. Each plot is associated with a farm registration number, indicating the farm operating the plot, regardless of the farmstead's location or whether the land is owned or rented. The dataset allows for a precise and spatially explicit analysis of farm activities, enabling the tracking of farm size development over time and the measurement of agricultural land concentration. The data shows that about half of the land transactions occur beyond municipality borders, highlighting the importance of defining the relevant market. The dataset reports a decrease in total agricultural area and the number of farms, alongside an increase in average farm size. It also records changes in farm registration numbers, indicating land transactions. The IACS data is used to derive concentration indicators and assess the impact of land market competition on farm expansion behavior.",

          "description": "The study uses a dataset of 9,754 first-price sealed-bid farmland privatisation auctions conducted in eastern Germany between 2007 and 2020. The data includes information on all bids and the auctioned goods, such as location, lot size, lot type (shares of arable, grassland, and other land), lot composition (number of parcels), and soil quality. Additionally, local experts' appraisals, which remain private to the auctioneer, are used to account for unobserved heterogeneity. These appraisals are based on publicly available results of transactions and auctions of similar lots in the same region during the 12 months prior to the auction. The dataset is used to test the presence of common values in bidders' valuations and the potential for a winner's curse in farmland auctions.",

Prices refer to agricultural land including arable land and grassland. Nominal agricultural land sales prices are available on country and federal state level on an annual basis. Land rental prices are also available at country and federal state level, but only for every second (1975-2007) or third year (after 2007) due to the frequency of the underlying Agricultural census. To conduct an analysis on a yearly basis, rental prices were linearly interpolated. The rental price data reflect prices of running contracts, i.e., they reflect the average of the rent paid for agricultural land during a contract period of several years. Rental price data for newly concluded contracts would have been more suitable for the analysis since they reflect the most recent information about expected productivity of land, but unfortunately, these data are not available for the desired time period. This implies that rental prices in the analysis appear more sluggish than they actually are. To conduct the analysis for Western Germany as a whole, federal state data on land sales and rental prices were used and averaged using the agricultural area of every federal state as weights. Nominal prices were converted into real prices by measuring inflation with the Consumer Price Index (CPI) for Germany published by Statistisches Bundesamt.",
