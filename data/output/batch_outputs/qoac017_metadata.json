      "description": "The dataset contains aggregated farmland price time series from 1991 to 2020 within Germany. Prices are aggregated within soil quality intervals and parcel size intervals, treated as panel units. The dataset has a balanced panel structure with 145 observations and 870 price data points in total. The number of recorded transactions used to aggregate the farmland prices were collected manually from the Statistische Jahrbücher in Germany from 1991 to 2020. The minimum number of transactions recorded per SQI interval is 3,929, and the maximum is 15,819. The dataset helps maintain soil quality constant within the defined interval while depicting the farmland price development over time. Other variables are not available due to the levels of data aggregation, and regional prices are not captured.",
