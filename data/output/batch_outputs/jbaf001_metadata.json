      "description": "The study conducted an economic experiment to simulate bargaining processes in the land rental market. Participants, who were either tenants or landowners, were asked to negotiate rental rates for hypothetical parcels of land. The experiment aimed to derive reservation utilities of both parties, reflecting their outside options and bargaining power. The data collected included rental rate offers and acceptance thresholds, with participants incentivized through vouchers based on negotiation outcomes.",
