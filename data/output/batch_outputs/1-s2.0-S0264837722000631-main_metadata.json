      "description": "The study uses data from the Integrated Administrative Control System (IACS) for Brandenburg, Germany, covering the years 2005 to 2017. This dataset includes all plots registered to receive European subsidies, based on a geo-referenced land parcel identification system. Each plot is associated with a farm registration number, indicating the farm operating the plot, regardless of the farmstead's location or whether the land is owned or rented. The dataset allows for a precise and spatially explicit analysis of farm activities, enabling the tracking of farm size development over time and the measurement of agricultural land concentration. The data shows that about half of the land transactions occur beyond municipality borders, highlighting the importance of defining the relevant market. The dataset reports a decrease in total agricultural area and the number of farms, alongside an increase in average farm size. It also records changes in farm registration numbers, indicating land transactions. The IACS data is used to derive concentration indicators and assess the impact of land market competition on farm expansion behavior.",
