      "description": "The study revisits public preferences for pasture landscapes in Germany, focusing on the presence of livestock in the landscape. It uses a Discrete Choice Experiment (DCE) to assess preferences for different landscape attributes, including the presence and number of dairy livestock, structuredness of the pasture, point landscape elements, linear landscape elements, and cost per household per year. The DCE was part of an online survey conducted in Germany with 475 participants, of which 449 were included in the study sample. The survey ensured representativeness concerning age, household income, federal state of residence, and size of the place of residence. The data was collected by an online-sampling company in September and October of 2017.",
