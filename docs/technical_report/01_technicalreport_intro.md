# Technical Report: AI-Powered Metadata Extraction for Agricultural Land Market Data in the LASI Use Case

## Introduction

### The LASI Project Context

This technical report presents the development and validation of an AI-powered metadata extraction system within the **LASI use case (Linking Agrosystem Data with Socio-economic Information)**, a component of the **FAIRagro consortium** under Germany's **National Research Data Infrastructure (NFDI)**. The LASI project addresses the pressing need for structured, FAIR-compliant approaches to socio-economic data on agricultural land markets, responding to the urgent challenges facing European and particularly German agricultural land markets.

### The Challenge: German Agricultural Land Market Data Crisis

Agricultural land markets in Germany and broader Europe face unprecedented pressures that demand evidence-based policy responses. Land prices are escalating, competition for agricultural land is intensifying among farming and non-farming actors, and non-farming ownership structures—including investment-driven acquisitions—are transforming rural landscapes. These developments have profound implications for rural development, resource access, intergenerational equity, and ecological sustainability.

Despite this urgency, the current data infrastructure surrounding land markets remains fragmented and underdeveloped. While extensive data sources exist—from cadastral records and administrative datasets to market reports and scientific surveys—these remain isolated, inconsistently structured, and difficult to access. The socio-economic dimensions of land markets particularly suffer from:

- **Lack of harmonized metadata standards**
- **Poor interoperability between data sources**
- **Limited public visibility and discoverability**
- **Legal and institutional access barriers**
- **Insufficient integration with agrosystem and environmental data**

This fragmentation creates an analytical gap, preventing researchers, policymakers, and stakeholders from obtaining coherent understanding of land market dynamics and their connections to agricultural sustainability, climate adaptation, and rural equity.

### Methodological Approach: AI-Enhanced Metadata Inventorization

This technical report documents the development and testing of an AI-powered metadata extraction and standardization system for German farmland research datasets, with particular focus on farmland sales transactions. The system utilizes artificial intelligence technologies integrated with Schema.org vocabulary to generate structured metadata from agricultural research publications for inventorization purposes.

The methodology combines OpenAI's language models with structured semantic web standards to process agricultural research literature and extract, structure, and standardize metadata through automated processes.

### Integration with FAIRagro Infrastructure

The developed system supports FAIRagro's mission of enabling data sharing and interdisciplinary research across agricultural, environmental, and economic domains. Integration points include:

- **BonaRes Repository Compatibility**: Metadata compatibility with Germany's agricultural data repository
- **INSPIRE Compliance**: Alignment with European spatial data infrastructure requirements  
- **DataCite Integration**: Support for persistent identifier systems and citation frameworks
- **NFDI Coordination**: Contribution to Germany's national research data infrastructure

### Schema.org Foundation for Agricultural Research

Alignment with Schema.org—a vocabulary for structured data on the web—enables:

- Discoverability of datasets through web search engines and data catalogs
- Interoperability with existing German research data infrastructures
- Reusability through standardized variable descriptions and provenance documentation
- Systematic inventorization of agricultural research datasets with consistent metadata structures

The resulting metadata framework outputs **JSON-LD format**—a lightweight, flexible standard that can be embedded in websites, submitted to data repositories, or integrated into internal metadata catalogs.

### Addressing the Agricultural Research Data Documentation Crisis

Our analysis reveals patterns in agricultural research data documentation. Through processing 22 representative farmland research publications, we document:

- **Limited dataset visibility**: Only 77% of publications contain identifiable farmland datasets despite broader data usage
- **Incomplete metadata**: Gaps in licensing (61% complete), access conditions (78% complete), and variable documentation
- **Geographic concentration**: Research bias toward Eastern German states due to data availability rather than research priorities
- **Temporal lag**: Delays between data collection and publication limiting policy relevance

### Target Audience and Applications

This report addresses multiple stakeholder communities:

**Agricultural Researchers**: Tools and methodologies for enhancing dataset documentation and discovery
**Data Managers**: Practical approaches to implementing metadata standards in agricultural research contexts  
**Repository Curators**: Automated metadata enhancement capabilities for institutional repositories
**Policy Makers**: Enhanced evidence base for agricultural land market policy development
**Technical Teams**: Implementation guidance for AI-powered metadata extraction systems

### Methodological Characteristics

The system demonstrates several characteristics in agricultural research data management:

1. **Automated Extraction**: AI-powered identification of dataset characteristics from unstructured research literature
2. **Standardization**: Consistent metadata structure across diverse publication types and research approaches
3. **Scalability**: Processing capabilities for large publication corpora with minimal manual intervention
4. **Quality Control**: Confidence scoring and validation mechanisms for metadata quality assessment

### Potential Applications

This work contributes to digital infrastructure for data-driven understanding of land markets, providing a foundation for evidence-based policymaking and sustainable land use research. Making agricultural research data more discoverable and reusable may support:

- Research reproducibility and cumulative knowledge building
- Policy evidence base development for land market interventions
- Interdisciplinary collaboration across agricultural, environmental, and economic research
- Scientific progress through improved data integration and reuse

The approach aims toward an agricultural research ecosystem where comprehensive metadata enables discovery, integration, and reuse of research datasets, supporting responses to challenges facing agricultural systems.

### Report Structure and Scope

While this system focuses on farmland sales transactions, the underlying methodology is **extensible to broader agricultural research domains** and provides a foundation for comprehensive enhancement of agricultural research data management within the FAIRagro ecosystem and beyond.
