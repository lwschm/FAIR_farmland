## 2. Insights from Extracted Farmland Research Data

### 2.1 Current State of Farmland Data Documentation

The analysis of 22 research publications reveals significant insights into the current landscape of farmland data documentation in German agricultural research:

**Geographic Concentration and Bias:**
The overwhelming focus on Eastern German states (Saxony-Anhalt: 33.3%, Brandenburg: 16.7%) reflects both the unique post-reunification land market dynamics and the availability of comprehensive transaction records through BVVG. However, this geographic concentration represents a significant limitation for understanding broader German farmland markets, with Western states and urban-adjacent areas underrepresented in available datasets.

**Temporal Coverage Patterns:**
Dataset temporal coverage ranging from 1994-2019 provides substantial historical depth, with **44.4% of datasets covering 15+ years**. This long-term perspective is crucial for understanding land market evolution, but the concentration of end dates around 2017-2019 suggests a significant lag between data collection and publication, potentially limiting the policy relevance of findings.

**Data Source Stratification:**
The dominance of government administrative records (BVVG: 44%, Land Valuation Committees: 33%) indicates both the critical role of public institutions in data provision and the potential bias toward officially recorded transactions. The relative scarcity of research-compiled datasets (6%) suggests limited independent data collection efforts, potentially constraining analytical diversity.

### 2.2 Variable Documentation Quality Assessment

The analysis reveals substantial heterogeneity in variable documentation quality:

**Core Variable Completeness:**
While fundamental transaction variables (price, area, date) achieve near-universal documentation (89-100%), contextual variables show significant gaps. Only **67% of datasets** include geographic coordinates, and **39% provide distance-to-urban-center measurements**, limiting spatial analytical capabilities.

**Methodological Transparency:**
Variable definitions vary significantly across studies, with inconsistent unit specifications and measurement methodologies. This heterogeneity complicates cross-study comparisons and meta-analytical efforts, highlighting the need for standardized variable definitions and measurement protocols.

**Access Information Deficiencies:**
Only **61.1% of datasets** provide clear license information, and **77.8% specify access conditions**. This documentation gap significantly impedes dataset reuse and violates core FAIR principles, particularly those related to accessibility and reusability.


## 3. The Crisis of Agricultural Research Data Documentation

### 3.1 Systematic Underdocumentation

Our analysis provides quantitative evidence of systematic underdocumentation in agricultural research data management. The identification of **only 18 datasets across 22 publications** (despite many papers likely utilizing additional data sources) suggests that researchers routinely fail to comprehensively document their data sources. This underdocumentation manifests in several critical areas:

**Incomplete Dataset Inventories:**
Many publications reference data sources without providing sufficient detail for replication or reuse. Statistical analyses often rely on multiple datasets, yet comprehensive documentation is typically provided for only primary data sources.

**Methodological Opacity:**
Variable construction methodologies, data cleaning procedures, and analytical exclusions are frequently underdocumented, limiting reproducibility and creating barriers to dataset integration across studies.

**Access Information Gaps:**
The low completion rates for license information (61.1%) and access conditions (77.8%) represent fundamental failures in research data stewardship, effectively rendering otherwise valuable datasets inaccessible to the broader research community.

### 3.2 Institutional and Systemic Factors

The poor state of data documentation reflects broader institutional and systemic challenges:

**Publication Incentive Misalignment:**
Academic reward systems prioritize novel findings over data quality and documentation, creating disincentives for comprehensive metadata provision. Journal word limits and reviewer priorities often marginalize detailed data descriptions.

**Infrastructure Deficiencies:**
Limited institutional support for research data management, inadequate repository infrastructure, and lack of technical expertise contribute to poor documentation practices. Many researchers lack training in metadata standards and FAIR principles implementation.
